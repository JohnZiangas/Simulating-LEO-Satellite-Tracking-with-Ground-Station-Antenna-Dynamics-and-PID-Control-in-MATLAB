# Simulating-LEO-Satellite-Tracking-with-Ground-Station-Antenna-Dynamics-and-PID-Control-in-MATLAB

This project was submitted as part of the semester project for the course **"Advanced Control Systems" (ECE_ELE760)** in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of the Peloponnese. The project explores fundamental concepts in orbital mechanics, antenna dynamics, and PID control, combining these elements to simulate a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite. It is designed for beginners interested in entering the space industry, particularly in the field of satellite communications.

The repository includes the main MATLAB code, which simulates the motion of a LEO satellite for 25 minutes as it passes above a ground station. Additionally, the ***"PID Controllers"*** folder contains MATLAB code for modeling a simple PID controller to track the satellite's azimuth and elevation. The files ***"Azimuth_Values.mat"*** and ***"Elevation_Values.mat"*** provide the azimuth and elevation data of the satellite when it is within the antenna's local horizon. These values are manually extracted from the ***"LEO_Satellite_Orbit_Simulation.mlx"*** file and can be used in conjunction with the PID controller.

A detailed PDF document is also included, explaining the methodology used to achieve the simulation and providing insights into the project development process.
